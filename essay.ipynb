    "\n",
    "What is the question you are trying to answer or the story that you are trying you tell?\n",
    "Through this project, we aim to answer the question - How much does news reporting and word association within headlines vary between different news sites? \n",
    "Our project aims to understand how news reporting varies over different sources using word associations as a metric. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this question or story important?\n",

    "\n",
    "What were the main steps your project made towards answering the question or telling the story?\n",
    "To test our hypothesis, we chose to make a word association program to analyze words that are commonly used in conjunction to our keywords\n",

    "Beyond answering these questions, you are free to structure this section however you wish."
